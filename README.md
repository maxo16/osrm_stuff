# osrm_stuff
This is where I'll put all of my osrm scripts, notes, etc. 

This is where I'll be putting the r scripts, etc. that I'll be using to interact with OSRM. I won't worry about putting that in the file. The install and running notes should enable one to get it installed and up and running pretty quickly. This is for a mac setup. Examples not using Berlin haven't been tried but I don't anticipate any issues there.
