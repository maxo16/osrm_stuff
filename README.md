# osrm_stuff

Here's a quick rundown of the files. 
 * Install and Run Notes: Instructions for getting OSRM up and running. 
 * install_script: should be able to just run this inside Ubuntu, should be complete explained in the Install and Run Notes. 
 * first_run_script: like the script above, just run it the first time. It handles downloading the map and setting up OSRM for the first time. 
 * run_script: should be able to run this each time to get OSRM up and running. 
 * testing.Rmd: an R Markdown used to make sure that OSRM is working each time. Have double-checked the results against Google Maps a few times and it looks like it's working well and consistently.
