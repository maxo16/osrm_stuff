# To Do
This'll be a running list of things to do

* Add instructions, or at the very list a link, to get Ubuntu up and running on Windows. 
* Figure out a way to fairly easily create graphs for different profiles. 
* Add link to a linux command line cheat sheet
    * Should probably include at the top the commands that I think will be most useful, it would be hard to come up with scripts that could handle every conceivable scenario and I'd reach the point of diminishing marginal returns anyway. Realistically it'd be hard to run this stuff anyway without any knowledge Ubuntu commands so a prospective user would just have to be familiar with basic set of commands. 
    
Ubuntu password I've been using: stanfordsus, I'll just keep this here for now.
